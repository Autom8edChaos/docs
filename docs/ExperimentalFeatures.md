# Experimental Features

## Explanation

As of version 2.5, Pickles includes experimental features. The goal of experimental features is to get rapid feedback about ideas. They are subject to change or removal at any time. The experimental features are not always completely thought through - including them and receiving feedback about them enables us to make better decisions about those features.

The experimental features can be including by using the [include experimental features argument](ArgumentsIncludeExperimentalFeatures.md)

## Current Experimental Features

### Alternative Markdown Provider in the Static HTML output format

We are trying out an alternative Markdown provider based on the [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked) library. This only applies to the static HTML format.

Please write your comments on GitHub in issue [#269](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/269).

### Mathematical Formulas in the Dynamic HTML output format

We are trying out [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) to render mathematical formulas in the dynamic HTML version. Currently, you need an Internet  connection while reading the documentation. If the feature progresses beyond the experimental stage, we will remove this limitation.

Please write your comments on GitHub in issue [#281](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/281).

### An Overview Dashboard for the DHTML Pickles Site with Summary Charts by Namespace and Tags

Gives an overview of the results by namespace and tags.
